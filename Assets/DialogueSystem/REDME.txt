This is a fully functional and feature-complete UNDERTALE-like dialogue system.
Because of it having been written at 5AM with no sleep, it has some... issues.
When exporting it to a different project, keep a few things in mind:
	- The AudioStream3D in the base dialogue_system.tscn should be changed
	depending on context of the new project
	- In the base dialogue_area_2d.gd on lines 41 and 53 there are references
	to the player and the root scene, respectively. These need to be changed
	to reflect the new player and root in the new project.
	- In the base dialogue_system.gd on line 178 there is a reference to an input
	that changes to the next dialogue item. This needs to be changed depending on
	the context for the project.
